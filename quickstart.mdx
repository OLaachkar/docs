## Get set in three steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your account">
    Sign up at verba.ink, then open the dashboard. That is where all your verbs
    live.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build the basics">
    Give your verb a name, a short description, and a few tags. Add an avatar
    if you have one, but do not overthink it yet.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test in chat">
    Open a chat, send a few prompts, and see how it sounds. Adjust personality
    or AI engine settings until it feels right.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Keep your first test prompts short. You will learn more in three tiny chats
  than in one giant paragraph.
