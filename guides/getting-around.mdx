## The basics

Think of Verba like a studio. You have a dashboard, a creation space, and a
chat room. Most of what you need is two clicks away.

  <Card title="Dashboard" icon="house">
    Your home base for verbs, stats, and quick actions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create" icon="plus">
    The guided flow for building a new verb.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Chat" icon="comments">
    Test your verb and tweak it fast.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Settings" icon="gear">

</CardGroup>

## Useful shortcuts

- Use search to jump to a verb fast.
- Pin the verbs you use the most.
- Keep a test chat open while editing personality.

<Tip>
  If you feel lost, open Quickstart again. It mirrors the creation flow.

## What to click first

1. Create a verb.
2. Open chat and test a few prompts.
