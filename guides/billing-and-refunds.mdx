## Buying credits

Credits power text, image, and voice features. Buy a pack when you need more
headroom, and keep an eye on usage for big tests.

## Refunds and issues

If a purchase looks wrong:

1. Check your billing history.
2. Grab the transaction ID.
3. Contact support with the details.

<Note>
  Refunds are handled through support. Keep receipts handy to speed things up.
