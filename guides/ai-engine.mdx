## The core knobs

These three settings do most of the work:

| Control | What it does | Quick tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Temperature | How creative replies feel. | Start at 0.7. |
| Top-p | How wide the word choices are. | Keep near 0.9. |
| Context | How many recent messages are sent. | Raise if it forgets. |

<Info>
  Model availability depends on your tier and may change over time. If a model
  is missing, switch to another option or check your plan.

## Web search

Turn it on only when you need fresh info. Keep it off for roleplay or
consistent lore to save credits.

<Note>
  Web search can increase response time and cost. Use it with intent.
