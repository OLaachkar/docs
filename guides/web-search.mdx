## What web search does

Web search lets your verb pull in fresh info when it is needed. It is great for
news, live data, and things that change fast.

## When to use it

- Current events
- Policies or pricing that change often
- Fresh releases or updates

## When to skip it

- Roleplay or storytelling
- Static lore and worldbuilding
- Anything that should stay consistent

<Note>
  Web search can cost more and slow replies. Use it only when freshness matters.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

If results feel noisy, turn web search off and reduce temperature.
