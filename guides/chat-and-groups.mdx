## Chat is your test lab

Use chat to hear the voice. Send short prompts, then tighten the personality or
AI settings until replies feel consistent.

## Group rooms

Groups are shared spaces where multiple users and verbs can talk together.
They are great for roleplay, brainstorming, and community bots.

## Smooth conversations

- Keep the topic focused for better replies.
- Use mentions when several people are talking.
- If replies drift, reduce temperature or shorten context.

<Note>
  If a group feels chaotic, move to a fresh chat and reintroduce the verb.
