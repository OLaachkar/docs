## Choose a clear avatar

Your avatar shows up everywhere, so it needs to read at a tiny size. Keep it
simple, centered, and high contrast.

- Use a single subject.
- Avoid busy backgrounds.
- Keep faces or icons near the center.

## Make the banner support the avatar

Banners are wide, so use them for mood. Think background texture, environment,
or a simple pattern that matches the character.

<Info>
  If the avatar is bright, keep the banner calm. If the avatar is subtle, make
  the banner pop.

## Tips for a clean look

- Stick to one color palette.
- Avoid text inside the image.
- Test on mobile and desktop.
