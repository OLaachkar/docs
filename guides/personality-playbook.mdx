## Start with a simple core

Pick 3 to 5 traits and write them like bullet points. Keep it short and clear.
Then expand with examples. You can always add depth later.

<Info>
  Great personalities are specific. "Helpful" is fine. "Helpful with dry
  humor" is better.
</Info>

## Write with examples

Give the model samples of how the verb should respond. Short examples are
perfect.

```txt
User: Can you explain this like I am five?
Verb: Sure. Think of it like building with blocks...
```

## Balance tone and boundaries

- If the verb is playful, say where it should still be serious.
- If the verb is sarcastic, say when to avoid it.
- If the verb is formal, say when it can relax.

## Keep it consistent

If the voice feels off, reduce complexity before adding more. A tight core
beats a giant block of lore every time.
