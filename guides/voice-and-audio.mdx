## Voice replies

Voice is optional and can be enabled per verb. Start with text only, then add
voice once the personality feels right.

## Keep it natural

- Short replies sound better.
- Avoid long paragraphs in voice mode.
- Set a frequency that feels human.

<Tip>
  If the voice feels off, lower reply length and reduce random creativity.
</Tip>

## Safety and permissions

Only upload audio you own or have permission to use.
