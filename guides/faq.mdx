### Can I make a private verb?

Yes. Set visibility to private and it will only show for you.

### Why do replies cost credits?

Credits cover model usage and compute. Bigger models and longer replies cost
more.

### Can I move a verb to Discord?

Yes. You can deploy a verb as a Discord bot when you have a bot token and
permissions.

### Why is web search off by default?

It is slower and more expensive. Turn it on only when you need fresh info.

### What if my image fails moderation?

Swap the image for something simpler and try again. Avoid explicit or hateful
content.
