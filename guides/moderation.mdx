## Why this exists

Moderation helps keep communities safe. It blocks harmful content while staying
permissive for normal creative use.

## What gets checked

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Profile images" icon="image">
    Avatars and banners are scanned before they go live.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Character content" icon="file">
    Personality text is checked for unsafe themes.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## If something gets blocked

- Read the error message.
- Tweak the content.
- Try again with a simpler version.

<Note>
  We would rather let safe content through than block good work by mistake.
