title: "Memory and knowledge"
description: "Keep your verb consistent over time."
---

## Two kinds of memory

- **Short-term context**: the recent messages the model can see.
- **Long-term memory**: notes or facts you store to keep a consistent world.

## When to add knowledge

Add facts your verb should never forget. Examples:

- Names and roles in a story world.
- Rules for a game or community.
- Preferences you want the verb to remember.

<Tip>
  Store the important stuff once, then keep chat prompts short.
</Tip>

## Keep it clean

- Review old entries and remove outdated info.
- Avoid dumping full conversations into memory.
- Use clear labels and short sentences.
